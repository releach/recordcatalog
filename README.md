# Django Records 
A Django app to track my rebuilding record collection.

For Django 3.1 to 4.0 and Python 3.8 to 3.10. 

The app has URLs, templates, and views to display the data, and both HTML forms and Django admin screens to add, update, and delete data. It also has a CSV export for logged in users and a simple REST API.

The templates use Bootstrap v4 for styling.

The primary models are Album, Artist, Genre, Label, Place, and Wanted. See recordcatalog/models.py for these models.
